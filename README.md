Full Back End REST microservice for the management of a back office panel and front end website for a e-commerce platform. <br/>
The project is developed in **PHP** with the **Laravel 12** framework and is designed to be used in conjunction with the [**Front End**](https://github.com/ValerioGc/shop-manager-fe) and [**Back office**](https://github.com/ValerioGc/shop-manager-bo) webapplications and communicate with each other through **REST API**. The code features a image conversion system, caching and compression of data, and a log management system. <br/>  It also integrates a translation service using google translate API for the back office and a docker system to run the application without having to install dependencies locally or to run the application in a production environment. <br/>

<h2 id="installation">üõ†Ô∏è Installation commands and dependencies:</h2>

##### 1. Install/Update dependencies

```sh
composer install / update
```

##### 2. Run migrations (create the database and tables)

php artisan migrate / migrate:fresh  // add :fresh if the db and tables already exist
```

##### 3. Run seeders (optional) (adds the defined data to the tables)

```sh
php artisan db:seed
```

##### 4. Create the link with storage for reading and writing files

```sh
php artisan storage:link
```

##### 5. Compile and start the development server

```sh
php artisan serve
```

##### 6. Run tests with php unit

```sh
php artisan test
```

<br/>

<h2 id="console">üå©Ô∏è Console commands:</h2>

##### 1. Clean application cache

```sh
php artisan cache:clear
```

##### 2. Clean route cache

```sh

<br/> 


<h2 id="deploy">üîÑ CI/CD</h2>

The project is integrated with GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The pipeline is triggered on every push to the deploy_prod/deploy_test branch. The pipeline includes the following steps:

- **Version and changelog extraction**: The version and changelog are extracted from the package.json file to be used in the release process.
- **Replace .env file**: The .env file is replaced with the .env.production or .env.test file based on the branch.
- **Test**: The project is tested using the test script.
- **Deploy**: The modified build is deployed to the production/test branch.
- **Github release**: The project is released on GitHub using the release script and **tagged with version numbers**.


### **Deploy scripts**

The deployment process is automated through scripts that can be used via artisan commands.

**Start the production pipeline on GitHub Actions.**

```
php artisan deploy prod
```

<br/>

**Start the test pipeline on GitHub Actions.**

```
php artisan deploy test
```

<br/>


<h2 id="docker">Docker integration</h2>

The project uses docker to run the application and perform other operations without having to install the necessary dependencies locally. The script generates several instances:
- Apache
- PHP (PROJECT) (VOLUME COMPOSER)
- MYSQL WITH PERSISTENCE (DB volume)
  
**Start the project with docker on windows environments**

```bash
php artisan docker:{mode}
```

**Start the project with docker on linux environments**
```bash
php artisan docker:{mode}
```

#### _Avaliable mode_
> - development
> - test
> - prod

<h2 id="cloudT">üåê Google Translate</h2>

The [**back office**](https://github.com/ValerioGc/shop-manager-bo) uses the text translation service offered by Google Cloud. <br/>
The service is Cloud translate API (*Cloud translation - BASIC*) <br/>
It has a limit of 500,000 characters per month and has a maximum number of characters per request. <br/>
The service uses an **API KEY** for authentication, which is saved in the **.env.production** and **env.test** files in the root of the project.

<br/>


<h2 id="convert">üîÉ Image conversion</h2>

The backoffice converts all incoming images that are not **. svg** or already in this format to the **. webp** format. <br/> 
The compression/quality ratio is configured and editable in **app/utils/ConvertImageUtils.php**

<br/>

<h2 id="cache">üì¶ Data caching and compression</h2>

The Back End applies the following middleware to all answers that it returns:

**CacheResponse** 
> *Search in the cache for the response, if it does not find it, compress with **zlib** and insert it. Resists cached response if present before running other middleware*

**CompressResponse** 
>*Compresses the response in gzip format*

**CacheControl** 
> *Apply a 6-hour eTag with code 304 (the cache is kept on the client until it expires)*

The cache is enabled in a production environment and is selectively reset based on the modified entities. can be deactivated with the parameter **CACHE_ENABLE** in the file **. env**/**.env.test**/**.env.production***.

<br/>


<h2 id="log">üìÉ Log management</h2>

Logs are split into files daily and are maintained for a defined number of days (5-7 days)
The configuration of logs, maintenance times and more is present in the file **/config/logging.php**

**Structure of LOG folders:**


* ``fe_config``- Log front end configuration
* ``entity`` - Log entities
    * ``products` - product logs, basket and scheduler elimination
    * ‚Äòfaq‚Äô‚Äô
    * ```etc... (same logic)`
* ‚Äòcache‚Äô`s - Log caching and compression response
* ``security` - Log security and login
* ```search``` - Log ricerca

<br/>


<h2 id="img">üìÉ Image Manipulation</h2>

The images are processed by the **ConvertImageUtils** controller which performs several steps:
- Conversion of images to **.webp** (excluding svg)
- Resizing images within the maximum dimensions
- Application of watermark with the logo on images

The settings for these processes are in the **.env** files (**.env.test**, **.env.production**) present in the root of the repository or the application on plesk
The values are **modifiable** directly from modifying the .env file.


### Functions Utils images:
  - **processImageForEntity**: Manages processes on the image based on the entity. Apply resizing, thumbnail creation, and adding watermark based on the entity.
  
  - **processSingleImage**: Handles uploading, saving and converting images to the. webp format (excluding .svg or .webp images).
  
  - **resizeImage**: Resize images to the maximum size provided in the env while maintaining the aspect ratio and only acting if the image exceeds the defined size.
  
  - **createThumbnail**: Generate thumbnails from the original image, resizing it to the defined measurements while maintaining the aspect ratio.
  
  - **applyWatermark**: Apply the logo as a watermark on product images, bottom right with maximum width and height measurements.
